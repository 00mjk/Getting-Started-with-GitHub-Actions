Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.

## Github Events

* on 
* env
* jobs 
* steps

## Core Concepts 

* Actions are your reusable units of code.
* You can use Action from the marketplace or create your own.
* To use an Action in an workflow run you must include it as a step.
* Create custom CI workflow that automate building and testing our code.
* Create custom CD workflowto automatically deploy our code to any cloud self hosted service or platform from our repo.
